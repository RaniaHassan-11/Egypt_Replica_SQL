# Egypt_Replica_Advanced_SQL_Project

## About Project :
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and optimize a relational database system, leveraging advanced SQL Server programming techniques.

The project includes:

1- Database Design: Crafting a robust database schema to meet the specified requirements.

2- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Creating a visual representation of the database schema, including entities, attributes, and relationships.

3-Relationships and Mapping: Defining and establishing relationships between tables, including primary and foreign keys, and ensuring proper data normalization.

4-Database Creation: Implementing the designed schema in Microsoft SQL Server.

5-Advanced SQL Server Programming: Utilizing advanced SQL Server features and techniques to enhance database functionality and performance.

## Detailed Components :
## 1- Database Design :
Define the tables, columns, data types, and constraints. 

Apply normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

## 2-Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) :
Develop a detailed ERD -using Drawio- to Specify entities, their attributes, and relationships. 

Identify and illustrate different types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

## 3-Relationships and Mapping :
Define primary keys for unique identification and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Implement constraints to enforce data integrity and consistency.

Ensure that relationships between tables are maintained accurately.

## 4-Database Creation :
Write and execute SQL scripts to create tables, relationships, and constraints in Microsoft SQL Server.

Import sample data into the database to test and validate the design.

## 5-Advanced SQL :
1- Stored Procedures: Create stored procedures to encapsulate complex queries and business logic.

2- Triggers: Implement triggers to automatically perform actions in response to specific events.

3- Views: Develop views to simplify complex queries and provide a customized perspective of the data.

4- Performance Tuning: Optimize SQL queries and database performance through indexing, query optimization, and monitoring.

5- cursor , Function ,Sequence .
